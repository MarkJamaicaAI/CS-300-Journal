# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem in the course that i was solving was to use different data models (Binary trees, Hash Tables, Linked Lists) and their appropriate 
usage within applications.     

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I tried to understand the relative strengths and weakness of each data structure. Data structures are essential to understand because they enable efficient organization, storage and retrival
of data, directly impacting the performanceand scalability of algorithms and application.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I overcame roadblocks by analyzing problems systematically, seeking guidance from resources like the snhu 24/7 tutoring and interatively testing solutions to ensure progress and learning.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project expanded my approach to designing software by encouraging a focus on user needs, interative development, and integrating scalable, reusable solutions to build 
more robust and efficient programs.
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project enhanced my abilitiy to write maintainable, readable and adaptable code by emphasizing clear structure, modular design and thorough documentation to support 
scalability and ease of collaboration.
